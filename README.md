# My_Learning
Contains some of the basics of ML which I tried out.

I will list out briefly what I tried out in these code : 

1. IPCV_Project : This is a small Image Processing Project which I did as a part of my course work during my Master's. This enhances the contrast of an image by using Exposure fusion framework. Reference : https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-64698-5_4
2. linear_regression : This is a small curious experiment done to see the performance of different methods to fit a line, given some non-linear points. I employed threee methods, one is using Gradient Descent (code from Scratch), using sckit-learn and using Neural networks. We tested the performance of all the three methods too at the last.
3. lr-ref : This was also another experiment to see the performance of the convergence of Linear Regression using Boston Housing Price Prediction using Closed form solution and an iterative method (i.e Gradient Descent).
4. time_complexity : This was to prove to myself in my early days that using in-built functions is always better interms of time-complexity and performace especially w.r.t Image Processing.
